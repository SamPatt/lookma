# LookMa

LookMa is a bare-bones React Native app built for Android users as an interface for their locally-run LLMs.

When toying around with running LLMs locally, I was annoyed at not having a simple way to connect to my server from my Android phone. I built LookMa to address this issue, and open sourced it.

It can store multiple server settings, and multiple conversations across those servers. 

All data is stored on device in a SQLite database.
